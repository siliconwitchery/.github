Here you'll find lots of examples and source material for all of our devices.

Most of the repositories are self documented, but if you need specific details about our hardware, it's best to check out our [documentation center](https://docs.siliconwitchery.com). 📚

### Part of a community

We love open souce, and our work wouldn't be possible without you. Do you have ideas or something you'd like to see supported? Join the [discussion](https://github.com/siliconwitchery/.github/discussions) 💬 and we'll see how we can help.

### Pushing STEM

Friday afternoons at Silicon Witchery is all about learning. Check out our STEM side project where we're building Stockholm's first community owned [Radio Astronomy Lab](https://github.com/frihamnstorget-space-observatory). 🔭

### Jobs
